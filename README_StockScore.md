## Use Cases

#### - High score = strong financials. Use it to spot great companies to invest in.

> When a high-scoring stock lags behind others in market performance—especially those with similar or even lower scores—it may suggest a value play or an undervalued stock.

#### - Conversely, if a low-scoring stock is delivering over-the-head returns, it could be a sign to reassess your position or lock in profits.

#### - This tool also helps you anticipate earnings results for upcoming reports. Based on past testing conducted by our StockLabs division, we've found that companies with higher scores are more likely to exceed earnings expectations.
  
> Disclaimer: This is not a perfect crystal ball. Please use it as a guide, not as an absolute predictor.

#### - This tool also allows you to identify stocks with negative scores, which may indicate potential candidates for shorting. However, this strategy is not recommended, and it is important to carefully assess the risks before proceeding. Use this feature at your own discretion. 

## Key Considerations
#### - `Submit Main Ticker` button sends the **ticker symbol, EPS and revenue** to the backend logic. To experiment with how different competitor lineups affect a company just press `Submit Competitor Tickers Only`.

#### - You can use different competitor lineups to evaluate various aspects of a company. For example, in the case of NVIDIA, you can first compare it to industry peers like INTC, AMD, QCOM, and TXN. Alternatively, you could swap these out for the MAG 7 companies to see which one stands out as the best investment opportunity at the moment.
> **Important Considerations**
> Using the wrong competitors for comparison may yield inaccurate results. For instance, comparing a company that operates in a different geographic market, such as the US, with one that operates globally could lead to misleading insights.
